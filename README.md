MSc Health Data Science at University of Birmingham - final research project. 

This was part of my research project for MSc Health Data Science at University of Birmingham, titled "Decoding Gliomas: Unravelling Key Genes, Pathways and Drug Development Opportunities".

The main aim of this research was to identify key genes, pathways and processes involved in primary WHO Grade III and glioblastoma, building a logistic regression model with LASSO for feature selection and classifying WHO III gliomas and GBM.
